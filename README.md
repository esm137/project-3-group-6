# project-3-group-6

This repository contains a folder called top_10 with all files required to build the database and flask api for the top 10 visualizer 
as well as the javascript app and html file required to run said visualization. Be sure to follow all instructions, have all python dependencies
installed and have pgadmin and the flask app up and running before accessing index.html.

Other visualizations are produced from the spotify_notebook file.  Be sure to install seaborn before running this.

All files will require the csv file from the zip found in the data folder to be extracted and saved in data before running. 

Due to size restrictions it was not possible to upload the uncompressed version to github
